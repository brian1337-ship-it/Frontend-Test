        <strong>
          This website is provided by Proximity Worldwide. Registered Address:
          Bankside 3, 90 Southwark Street London SE1 OSW. We take very seriously
          the privacy of our website users and the security of their personal
          information.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For your convenience, this website contains links to several other local
        Proximity and partner websites. The privacy policies and procedures
        described here do not apply to those sites; we suggest contacting those
        sites directly for information on their data collection and distribution
        policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this privacy policy is to set out the principles
        governing our use of the personal information that we may obtain about
        you. By using the website, you agree to this use so we ask you to read
        this privacy policy carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We therefore ask you
        to check it occasionally to ensure that you are aware of the most recent
        version that will apply each time you access this website.

        <span class="redTitle">PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Proximity may collect and store personally identifiable information,
        such as your name or email address, when it is voluntarily submitted to
        us via this website. Proximity and the companies we hire will use this
        information to comply with your enquiry about careers or as otherwise
        disclosed to you when you submit your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use that information to contact you via email, phone or as
        specified in your enquiry. We will not otherwise transfer the personally
        identifiable information you provide via this website to any third party
        unless otherwise disclosed to you or required by law. Please note we may
        disclose your personal information to the purchaser of the business, if
        Proximity or part of it, including this website, is sold to another
        organisation, or Proximity merges with another organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proximity may also collect and store aggregate or anonymous information
        about user contact with and use of the site. In addition, at times, we
        may send your web browser a “cookie”, a small data file that’s stored on
        your hard drive, to help us provide you with a better website
        experience. Information obtained in connection with the site may be
        intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information
        obtained through sources other than the site, including both offline and
        online sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use the aggregate or anonymous information we collect about our
        customers and traffic patterns to better understand your needs and
        improve the experience we deliver via the website. We may also, from
        time to time, share this anonymous information with reputable third
        party vendors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="redTitle">JOB APPLICANTS</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the information you provide during an enquiry or application
        process will only be used for the purpose of progressing your
        application, or to fulfil legal or regulatory requirements, if
        necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not share any of the information you provide during the
        recruitment process with any third parties for marketing purposes, or
        store any of your information outside the European Economic Area. The
        information you provide will be held securely by us and/or our data
        processors, whether this information is in electronic or physical
        format.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will use the contact details you provide to us to contact you to
        progress your application. We will use the other information you provide
        to assess your suitability for the role you have applied for.
        <strong>&nbsp;</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are unsuccessful in your job application we will retain your
        information for 5 years after your application. If you are successful in
        your job application we will retain your information in line with our
        staff employment data protection policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information we ask for is used to assess your suitability for
        employment. You don’t have to provide what we ask for but it might
        affect your application if you don’t.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

        We have a commitment to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security
        of your information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data

      </p>
      <p>
        Protecting the privacy of the young, i.e. children under the age of 13,
        is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain
        information at our site from those we actually know are under 13, and no
        part of our site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If a child
        has provided us with personal information, we ask that a parent or
        guardian of the child contact us at{" "}
        <a href="mailto:georgia.wright@proximityworld.com">
          webmaster@proximityworld.com
        </a>
        &nbsp;if they would like the information submitted by the child deleted
        from our database. We will use all reasonable efforts to delete such
        information from our database.
